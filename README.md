**The repository is currently in progress!**  
The file `Line_command_interp_eORCA25.py` contains the code to execute the command line from your terminal using the following command:

```bash
./Line_command_interp_eORCA25.py your_model_file.nc your_model_mask_file.nc a_file_with_swot_data.nc output_file.nc
```

The data needed for testing will soon be provided via an S3 endpoint. However, if you already have eORCA25 data and a SWOT file, you can start testing the tool
